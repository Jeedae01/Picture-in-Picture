# This is a repo that has the codes for watching two different screens on your mobile or laptop at the same time. It is similar to multi tasking on some android devices. 
However, the effectivenes of the picture in picture is the ability to provide the user with two screens where two separate things can be done.
Moreover; the picture in picture can be seen as screen sharing and it's a good repo to practise your javascript skills.
